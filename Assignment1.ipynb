Q10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it? 'I have eaten' + 99 + ' burritos.'

It causes an error because you can only concatenate string with string and not int(in this case, 99). To fix it, either typecast 99 to string or use 99 as '99'.

'I have eaten' + '99' + ' burritos.' 
'I have eaten' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
